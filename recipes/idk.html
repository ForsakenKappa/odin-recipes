    <h3> Warning: may cause █████████ and also ████████, but very rarely can also ████ ███████!</h3>
    <p1> Ah, the good ol' <strong>ʿdŮk枅e9𘩃</strong>! Every one █████ this as a child in the ██80!
         It is known by many names, such as <strong>Xǡֵ{n/⠃ˣ⸬Q7挕E</strong> or <strong>30ేガ</strong> as they call it in the east of ██████
         And today we gonna learn how to make one! </p1>
    <p1> Recipes do vary but my grandma taught me this one. We'll need: </p1>
    <ul>
      <li>Pinch of c̶͓̼͓͖͎̭͓̥̥̯̝̞͇͆͌̍̓͋̀̽͑͐͐̾͠o̸̧̻͎̪̱͔͔͎̮̙̎̽͘s̴͈̻̦̘̝͚̽̇̅́̀̿̐̐̉̄̌̉̒̚͜m̴̻͔̣̻̖͍̄͌͆͐̇͌̀̓͝i̴̲̾̈́̈́̈́͊͊͗͊͆͘ç̶̡̢̧̧̞̤̲̤͔̜͚̫̬̅́̇͠ ̷̧̰̗͈̪̰̥̭͚͆̎͠ͅͅv̶̧̧̦͔̥̭̭̞̖̬͇̬̤̖͎̓̎̄ơ̸̧̢̼̞̟̭̞̆͌̀̑́̎̍͐̎̚̕͝i̴͚̦̠̞̲̬͇͎͉̿̎̄̒̀̅̄̏͒͒̎͐͆͘͜d̴̫̻͇̣̦̎́̓̉̈́͆́̀̅̅̀͑̃̚</li>
      <li>Already cooked and prepared ǟȶɦǟȶօȶɦ ֆɛʀʋǟռȶ. How to make one I thaught <a href='https://jodi.org'>here</a></li>
      <li>████████████</li>
      <li>Carved pumpkin</li>
      <li>Very tasty by itself, but hard to get, ₴ⱧɄ฿₦ł₲₲ɄⱤ₳₮ ₴₱₳₩₦</li>
    </ul>
    <p1> And we gathered of the ingridients, so what do we do now? Oh, that's easy, just follow this steps: </p1>
    <ol>

      <li>Let the ₴ⱧɄ฿₦ł₲₲ɄⱤ₳₮ ₴₱₳₩₦ CONSUME THE  cooked ǟȶɦǟȶօȶɦ ֆɛʀʋǟռȶ. It would make ʿdŮk枅e9𘩃 more ██████ as my grandma said </li>
      <li>Make Carved pumpkin and ████████████ interact with each other. Keep the eye on pumpkin or you know what's going to happen! </li>
      <li>While waiting, preheat your 丂ひｱ乇尺刀の√ﾑ ᄃﾚひ丂ｲ乇尺 to around plank tempature.
        It's okay if it would be lower or higher by around 10.000 degrees Kelvin</li>
      <li>After preparation are complete put the results into the 丂ひｱ乇尺刀の√ﾑ ᄃﾚひ丂ｲ乇尺
         for around ███ ████ilions ████s </li>
      <li>Poke with Tungsten rod to check for readiness</li>
      <li>Add c̶͓̼͓͖͎̭͓̥̥̯̝̞͇͆͌̍̓͋̀̽͑͐͐̾͠o̸̧̻͎̪̱͔͔͎̮̙̎̽͘s̴͈̻̦̘̝͚̽̇̅́̀̿̐̐̉̄̌̉̒̚͜m̴̻͔̣̻̖͍̄͌͆͐̇͌̀̓͝i̴̲̾̈́̈́̈́͊͊͗͊͆͘ç̶̡̢̧̧̞̤̲̤͔̜͚̫̬̅́̇͠ ̷̧̰̗͈̪̰̥̭͚͆̎͠ͅͅv̶̧̧̦͔̥̭̭̞̖̬͇̬̤̖͎̓̎̄ơ̸̧̢̼̞̟̭̞̆͌̀̑́̎̍͐̎̚̕͝i̴͚̦̠̞̲̬͇͎͉̿̎̄̒̀̅̄̏͒͒̎͐͆͘͜d̴̫̻͇̣̦̎́̓̉̈́͆́̀̅̅̀͑̃̚ to your likeness </li>
