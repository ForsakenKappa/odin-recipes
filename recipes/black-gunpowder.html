    <h3> Goes boom! </h3>
    <p1> So, my little anarchist, you want to make some things go BOOM?</p1>
    <p1> Then I'm glad you came across this website, because you'll learn how to make a gunpowder! </p1>
    <p1> Here are some of the ingridients you would need: </p1>
    <ul>
      <li>Stick x1</li>
      <li>15 carrat diamond x2</li>
      <li>Your grandfather's workbench</li>
      <li>Sapper suit</li>
    </ul>
    <p1> I hope you got all the stuff to get some gundpowder! But a quick warning: </p1>
    <h4> Gunpowder is highly explosive! Don't just get it because you can! And procces of getting it is extremely dangerous! </h4>
    <p1> So, here are the steps to get some explosive sand: </p1>
    <ol>
      <li>Wait until midnight</li>
      <li>Using your stick and two diamonds craft a sword</li>
      <li>Put on sapper suit</li>
      <li>Whilst equiped with a sword go outside into the darkness. You are looking for a green penis-shaped hellish abomination.</li>
      <li>If you found one, try to sneak up to it and quickly slay with your sword. Beware, that green thing would and will explode when provoked</li>
      <li>If you didn't found one of them, keep looking. They appear only in full darkness.</li>
      <li>After you killed one of them, they will turn into pure black gundpowder</li>
      <li>Enjoy making TNT with it and some sand! Beware of admins and mods, they could ban you if you overdo the BOOM part.</li>
    </ol>
